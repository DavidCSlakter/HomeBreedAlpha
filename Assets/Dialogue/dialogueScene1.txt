Lucas,Where...where am I?
Doctor,Everything is fine son take it easy
Doctor,How do you feel?
Lucas,Fine..I guess..Im a little lightheaded.
why cant I remember anything?%your amnesia is due to some sort of injury to your head/when I found you, you were passed out near the wall/didn't want to leave you there so I carried you back here and patched you up.[who are you?%My name is Fred, Im the doctor in this part of the town/I frequently patrol the wall to help anyone who might have lingered there for too long/new souls tend to be hopeful in finding a way out, but they will just tranquilize you if even come within 10 feet of the wall[where am I?%This is my office, right on the edge of shaggy town
Doctor,My guess is that you were sedated near the wall and hit your head on the way down
Doctor,Your memories should return with time 
Doctor,..do you recall how you got here son?
Lucas,no..Its hard to remember anything right now
Lucas,..I think my name is Lucas?
Doctor,well ok Lucas, I want you get some more rest now, you're fine to stay here if you want, we'll have to make sure no one finds out...
Lucas,Why can't anyone find out?
Doctor,well...your're a human arnt you?
,*KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK*
Doctor,Quick! find somewhere to hide
Doctor,I can't risk anyone seeing you here
