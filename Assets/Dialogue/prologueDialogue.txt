-Ever since the dawn of man, humans and wolves have evolved together, helping one another survive.
-These domesticated wolves, called dogs, would hunt with their humans and protect them from dangers.
throughout the centuries the cycle would continue, and new dogs would be taken care of and trained by their owners
-As technology improved however, dogs were less used for their hunting abilities. 
since dogs were an inconvience to train, advanced machines began to take their place as companions
As a result, dogs were unable to compete as pets, and for a long time, their species was threatend.
-Still, humans longed for the comfort of other living creatures.
-This sparked a mission for scientists to make dogs smarter in order to fulfill the roles that a modern family would need 
-a new gene in dogs was created and spread, causing humans to adopt these more intelligent creatures.
-Eventually dogs who wern't as intelligent went extinct.
