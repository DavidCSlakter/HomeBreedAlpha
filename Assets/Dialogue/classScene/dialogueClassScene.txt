Teacher, From there you could say natural selection went its course and more advanced voice communication from dogs began to emerge.
Teacher, In modern day, as you may already know, some of the dogs in our homes are almost as intelligent as we are. 
Teacher, Alright class that concludes our lesson for the day.
Teacher, We have about a week left before your test on the evolution chapter, so make sure that your're not falling behind on studying for that. 
Teacher, Hm...theres still a couple more minutes of class time before we are able to log out so I would recommend that you use this time to work on your paper.
Teacher,/B I dont know about you all, but as soon as that clock hits 3:45 im hitting the log out button.
Teacher, I'll be here if you have any questions.
